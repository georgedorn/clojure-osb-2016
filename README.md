# Introduction to Clojure @ OSB 2016

This is where kf will be putting the materials for the ["Introduction to Clojure" session](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1809) at Open Source Bridge 2016!

Currently, this repo contains guides for installing the software required for the session; the actual materials will be added the morning of the session, June 22.

Choose whichever OS you use below, then follow the directions! If you're having trouble installing something, drop by the ["Clojure setup help for 'Introduction to Clojure'" session](http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1925) on Tuesday at some point between 5:45pm and 7:30pm in B201.
